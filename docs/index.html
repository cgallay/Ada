            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="lead">For our final project in Dr. Robert West’s Applied Data Analysis class of Autumn 2017, we decided to focus on one of the freely-available largest collection of music datasets online: the Million Song Dataset. The core of this dataset, is the feature analysis and metadata for one million songs, provided by The Echo Nest.</p>
            <p class="lead">Since the emergence of compact disc, the music industry capabilities has expanded exponentially. Data could be stored efficiently and aggregated to this day. With the current computing capabilities, the field of big data analysis has emerged and allows us to explore and  try to discover the secrets hidden behind what  makes music such a magical and essential part throughout our lives.</p>

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p class="lead">The entire dataset size is 280 GB. We however, based our first analysis on a subset of 10,000 songs (1%, 1.8 GB compressed) in order to apply our algorithms on the bigger one later.
              You will see below the first steps of our approach on this dataset</p>

            <img src="images/year_distr.png" width="800" height="400">
            <p class="lead"> From this distribution we can see that the dataset contains much more sample starting from the 90's. This could be related to the emergence of the compact disc technology developed by Sony and Philips and launched in 1982 in which much more informations could be stored. </p>

            <h2>The music genre challenge</h2>
            <p class="lead"> The first challenge on which we wanted to focus, was to know, if it was possible to group the sample under a music genre according to their metadata. To detect the genre of a song we based our analysis on the artist_terms attribute. Unfortunately this feature doesn't directly contain the genre of the artist (song), but rather terms that people have associated with this artist, most of the time this terms do correspond to genre but they might also be noise (such as a city). An other drawback of this feature, is that there is a lot of different sub-genre. To deal with that, we performed LDA (Latent Dirichlet Analysis) to find 10 "super-genre".</p>

          <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
            <h5>LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation):</h5>
            <p class="lead">In natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, in our case, if observations are terms in the list of each sample’s artist_terms feature, it would describe the feature as a mixture of a small number of topics attributable to one general related topic. The topic here would be a genre and the aim is thus to group the tags into one bigger category representing a type of music.</p>

            <p class="lead">When visualizing the song through time on the map we realised that a song only stayed one epoch (frame) visible. For us it doesn't reflect the reality as once a song is released it will perdure for a certain amount of time. To simulate that we extend our data with duplicates of the song up to 10 years after its first apparition. We didn't want to naively duplicate the song as it would appear as a new song for 10 year long. Taking that into account, as time pass we decrease the song weight (its importance at representing the genre).</p>

            <h2>Genre analysis through space:</h2>
            <p class="lead">Now, lets try to put our genre classification into another perspective. More precisely, we want to confront the given labeling (tags) of the songs with some of their content informations. To do that, we focused on these given features : "tempo","loudness" with respect to the our genre labeling.</p>
            <p class="lead">However, we can see below, that the box plots for the features :  “loudness” and "tempo" are not really relevant with respect to the defined genres.</p>
            <img src="images/box_plot_tempo.png" width="700" height="400">
            <img src="images/box_plot_loudness.png" width="700" height="400">
            <p class="lead"> The correlations between them do not give better results neither: </p>
            <img src="images/heatmap.png" width="600" height="400">
            <p class="lead">We thus decided to have a closer look at the “segment_timbre” feature.</p>
            <p class="lead">According to the Echonest documentation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Segments: are a set of sound entities (typically under a second) each relatively uniform in timbre and harmony. Segments are characterized by their perceptual onsets and duration in seconds, loudness (dB), pitch and timbral content.</li>
              <li>The segment_timbre is a 12-dimensional vector which captures the “tone colour" for each segment of a song. In order to facilitate our calculations we decided to take the mean of all segments to represent each song with one single vector of size 12.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">In order to see if we could get information from it, we started by applying on the vectors of a given genre, a principal component analysis (PCA). PCA, is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. We can see below, that the representation in space of two sets of songs, (coming  from two different genre with respect to their two principal components values give some relevant results. Indeed, we can see well defined separation between the two music genre.</p>
            <img src="images/PCA_39.png" width="600" height="400">
            <p class="lead">However, we can see that the points overlap. We thus decided to try a 3d approach.</p>

            <h2>Lets make it 3D !</h2>
            <p class="lead">Once trained using metadata, we use our model to predict the genre distribution of each song based on their timbre information.  The training and prediction were performed using a simple neural network (you can have a look at our github notebook for detailed explanations). Based on this prediction we plot the songs in a 3 dimensional space using t-SNE. For a better visualization purpose we colored each song by they super genre belonging.
              You can now explore it and verify by yourself the accuracy of our results !<span style="color:blue"> (We advise you to use a mouse to enjoy the complete diving experience).</span>

              Clicking on a point give you access to a preview of the song ! ;)
