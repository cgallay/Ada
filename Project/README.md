# Music Style Analysis

# Abstract
The goal of this project is to discover how new styles of music emerge in society with respect to location, rapidity of trend propagation or also consistency in time of a style's popularity. Furthermore, we want to explore the influence of a hit/artist on other artists/styles. To do so, we will make use of the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) dataset. We would like to enrich our data by scraping information on Youtube about the evolution of views with respect to time. A lot of different insights can be explored with such a dataset and we want to bring forward links between music and external factors that can explain somehow the why of a success.
To make the correlations more intuitive, we want to present the data with some nice visualizations interaction with chronological plots and maps

# Research questions
- How much does a hit or artist influence the emergence of a new style trend.
- What are the external factors that make a song/style/artist become a success.
  - Does a certain style coincide with a historical event
  - Is it a local success
  - Does it have an emotional impact on certain persons
