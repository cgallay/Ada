# Title

# Abstract
The goal of our project is to compare the network operator in Switzerland to helps people truly select the best operator for they needs. To answer this question we would use the an external dataset provided by [Ookla](http://www.ookla.com/). At the moment of writing this we still doesn't have recieved a feedback from Ookla on whether we are allow to use there dataset, that is why we are proposing you with an other [backup project](../Project/README.md).

Given that we get the dataset, we would like to build an interactive map of Switzerland where the user would be able to zoom on region to see a heat map of the network speed per operator.

Depending on the richness of the dataset would like to add the possibilty for the user to travel in time to see how the network speed changed with the years. This is interesting in order to see which ISP is really investing for a better network.

A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions
Here are a list of the answer we would try to answer if time and the data allow us to do so: 
- Which is the best ISP in Switzerland ?
- When is the network mostly saturated ?
- Which ISP is mostly investing itself into building a better network ?

# Dataset
The full dataset is not freely awailible but a [sample one](http://go.ookla.com/nmdata) can be downloaded. 

Based on the sample we can allready exctract some interesting information for us such as test_date, client_country, network_operator_name, is_ISP, device, client_latitude, client_longitude.


List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
If we get the dataset quickly enough, here is what we plan to do for the next deadline:
- Exploring the dataset
- Find a good library to represent our data on a map
- 

Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

# Questions for TAa
None

Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.
