# Title

# Abstract
The goal of our project is to compare the network operator in Switzerland to help people truly select the best operator for they needs. To answer this question we would use an external dataset provided by [Ookla](http://www.ookla.com/). As we write this, we still haven't recieved a feedback from Ookla on whether we are allowed to use their dataset. That's the reason why we are proposing an other [backup project](../Project/README.md).

Given that we get the dataset, we would like to build an interactive map of Switzerland where the user would be able to zoom on regions in order to see a heat map of the network speed per operator.

Depending on the richness of the dataset, we would like to add the possibilty for the user to travel in time to see how the network speed changed over the years. This is interesting in order to see which ISP is really investing for a better network and where.

Finally, this project could have a social approach in a sense that a lot of people pay for a service that do not always fullfill its obligations.

A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions
Here are a list of the answer we would try to answer if time and the data allow us to do so: 
- Which is the best ISP in Switzerland for a specific user needs ?
- When is the network mostly saturated ?
- Which ISP is mostly investing itself into building a better network ?

# Dataset
The full dataset is not freely awailible but a [sample one](http://go.ookla.com/nmdata) can be downloaded. 

Based on the sample we can allready exctract some interesting informations for us such as test_date, client_country, network_operator_name, is_ISP, device, client_latitude, client_longitude.


List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
If we get the dataset quickly enough, here is what we plan to do for the next deadline:
- Exploring the dataset
- Find a good library to represent our data on a map.



Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

# Questions for TAa
None

Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.
